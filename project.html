    <h2>Background Information</h2>
<p>My name is Iris Murray and I am 21 years old. I orginally come 
from Dunfermline, Fife; but I moved across to Edinburgh in 2021 
in the hope of furthering my education.
I am currently in my first year of studying 
<a href="https://www.napier.ac.uk/courses/bsc-hons-sound-design-undergraduate-fulltime">Sound Design</a> at <a href="https://www.napier.ac.uk">Edinburgh Napier University</a></p>
<br>
<P>I decided to pursue a degree in sound design as music and sound in general 
has always been something i've found facsinating. I had intially decided to study music,
however I ended up dropping out in first year when i realised the course was very different 
from what i had expected. I reapplied twice to various music courses but ultimately decided 
that they weren't for me & that I was infact not willing to relocate as I had built a stable 
life for myself in Edinburgh. I did find this challenging as the majority of people around me
were studying, had graduated, or had some sort of plan. This left me feeling like most things I 
did were infact a means to an end.
<br>
I have always believed that everything happens for a reason, 
and there must be some explaination as to why I inevitably found an excuse not to pursue studying music
despite putting so much effort into course applications and portfolios. I realised that every year
I had applied to study music I had also applied to study Sound Design at ENU, maybe there was a reason
that although it wasnt my first choice, it was still consistently in my choices. I looked into it
properly and decided I might as well give it a go, as it really piqued my interest.
To be completely honest I am so glad that I took the leap in pursuing this course, as so far
i have found all aspects of it very interesting. 
<br>
This even stretches to the more digital aspects of the course, which is surprising as I have always
found technology extremely boring and accepted that its something that I just dont 'get'.
This is of course mortifying as being part of the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/digital-native.
asp">'Digital Native'</a> generation I feel as though I am expected to breeze through understanding
 new & current technology. I would go as far as to brand myself a technophobe,
 see article <a href="https://technophobiapro.com/f/technophobia-gen-z-and-the-multi
 -generational-plague">here</a> for more information.
<br>
Overall, I feel extremely positive about the course so far and am excited
for what it wil bring in the future, however i might be viewing it through
the rose-tinted glasses of delusion as I am only in my first trimester of my first year.

<h1>Sound Design</h1>
<h2>Course Overview</h2>
<p>This course covers a broad range of topics from digital design
 & user experience to sonic culture and foley. This variety of 
 in-depth learning gives students the opportunity to explore many 
 different fields and disciplines within the digital and creative 
 community.</p>
 
 <h1>First year Modules</h1>
 <p>Year 1 contains six different modules split over two trimesters.</p>

 <h1>Current Learning and Folio Items</h1>
 <p>I am currently in trimester 1, so the modules i'm studying are:
    <ul>
    <li>Being Digital</li>
    <li>Experiencing the Digital city</li>
    <Li>Sonic Culture</Li>
    </ul>
    Within these pages, you will find more information on the module as well as related folio items
 </p>

<h1>Interests in chosen degree</h1> 
   <p>Before beginning this course, my intial understanding of Sound Design was very surface level.
    As a musician I was familiar with music production and how music is used in other settings, such as retail and advertising. 
    In addition to this I was moderately familiar with sound in films; and how music, foley, 
   and other sound effects help convery emotion or storylines. Beyond this, I was unsure of the large 
   scope of elements sound design actually covers.  
   <br>
   As I am becoming more familiar with how & where sound is used, I have realised that it is something that
   has always been a huge part of my life, even stretching back to when i was very young, to 
   before I understood what the concept of sound even was.
   <br>       
   For example, from a young age i have listened to audiobooks to help me sleep, I
   specifically enjoyed audiobooks containing sound effects and music as opposed to audiobooks consisting
   solely of narration. Specifically "Horrible Histories" audiobooks based on the book series of the 
   same name by Author <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/304506/terry-deary">Terry Deary</a>
   Deary. During one of the modules within the course, we learned about and as a group created
   soundscapes containing narration. This was intially an intimdating project, however upon learning
   what this actually consisted of, I realised it was something i was familiar with. 
   It clicked that the Horrible Histories audiobooks I had religiously listened to for years were 
   in fact soundscapes and I was infact familiar with the concept.

        <h1>Career Goals</h1>
        <p>This course has opened my eyes to the wide range of career options. ultimately I would
          like to be do freelance audio engineering and music production. 
          the artist im probably most inspired by is aphex twin. here is a 
          video describing his relationship with music</p>
