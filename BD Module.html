        <h1>Coursework</h1>
        <p>The focus of this assesment was creating a powerpoint presentation regarding 
            the ethical, social and legal issues of a current digital technology.
            The presentation had to include one example of each issue to promote awareness 
            of the implications of the chosen topic. My group choose<strong>Facial Recognition 
            Technology</strong>,due to both its cultural relevence, and large scope for research</p>
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>The process began with us first brainstorming ideas before deciding to do the presentation on 
        subject <Strong>"Facial Recognition Technology"</strong>. We did some background research and 
        delegated specific research topics to each group member. Once everyone had the information
         required, I wrote a script and from that, the points were summarised into bullet points and 
         implemented into the powerpoint. Finally, we recorded the narration, embedded the audio in the powerpoint, and submitted.
