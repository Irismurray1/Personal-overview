   <h1>Hobbies</h1>
            <strong>Learning Instruments</strong>
           <p>I started playing piano when I was around 10 years old. Since then I have expanded to guitar
            Bass, ukelele & banjo. I find music theory very interesting and often use it to improve 
            my skills across these instruments. Playing and learning these instruments fills me with
            joy and allows me to relax and unwind when i am stressed. This is similar to the guitar I play:

            <strong>Listening to Music</strong>
            <p>Music listening - I have always been passionate about all aspects of music, from 
                reading up on the history of the subject, to writing and producing
                original work. My favorite element however, is listening to old and 
                current favorites, and exploring new genres. For me, the most effective 
                & entertaining way to do this is through the media company <a href="
                https://www.nts.live"NTS></a>This website contains various music-related 
                media and is best known for its radio shows spanning many genres and themes. Here is an excerpt
                from the breakfast show </p>

                <p>Its hard for me to pick a favourite song, but a strong contender is "Plantasia" by <em>Mort Garson</em>
                which was released in 1976. Here is an excerpt from the song:<br>

            <h1>Work</h1>
                <h2>Current work</h2>
                <p>I have a background in culinary spanning 3 years, and currently work as a chef at 
                    Indigo Yard. However, since beginning my studies, I have traded in my grueling 60-hour weeks 
                    for a much lighter 12-24 hours.</p>

            <h1>Other Career Ambitions</h1>
            <h2>Food Blog</h2>
            <p>I enjoy cooking in my spare time and have ammased quite the library of recipes. This is not a full time career option for me but more of a hobby on the side that would provide extra income.
